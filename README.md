# Covid Tracker
A map-based MERN stack website for tracking COVID-19 cases. This has become essential with the rise of COVID-19 around the world. We saw some countries have opted to build systems for better tracking cases of the virus. 

The map is based on the MapBox API and the authentication is done using Auth0. Signup and login using Gmail is supported.
